# Python-Cleaning-Project

Data Cleaning and Transformation with Python

This project demonstrates a Python script for cleaning and transforming a raw dataset rom an Excel workbook. The script handles a multi-table dataset, performs various data cleaning operations, and then splits the data into separate tables, which are saved to different sheets within a single Excel workbook.
