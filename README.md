# Python-Cleaning-Project

Data Cleaning and Transformation with Python

This project demonstrates a Python script for cleaning and transforming a raw dataset from an Excel workbook. The script handles a multi-table dataset, performs various data cleaning operations, and then splits the data into separate tables, which are saved to different sheets within a single Excel workbook.

The goal of this data cleaning is to transform the dataset to a level of cleanliness that it provides clear insights to stakeholders. The data comes in as a long table with multiple tables and redundant columns, which are then dropped, renamed, and subset as required to get individual tables that are then written to separate sheets in the same Excel workbook.
